In this document, we will go over some checks that need to be applied for ABBY Finereader document so we do not have to do extra work down the line

- Italics text should be correct
- Greek text should be italics
- Ensure all `c.` in footnotes are italicized
- All parentheses are *not* italicized
- Make sure italicized `I` is not backwards slash
- Make sure `II` is not `IL`, `VI` is not `VL`
- Make sure there are no commas with spaces before " , ", " : ", and " ; "
- All footnote commentary that is not italicized has not italics
- Footnote citations where two titles are dilineated with `e`, make sure the `e` is not italics so it translates to `and` (also applies to capital `E`)
- Make sure footnote is not body format and vice versa
- Make sure footnotes that span accross multiple columns (and pages) are manually put on same line
- Remove hyphens
- Replace all `'` with `â€™`

## Final Checks

### Body Text
These are checks that should be executed manually *after* the work has been translated

- CTRL-F "of art" and "history of art" and see if it is not more appropriate to translate to "of the art"
- Make sure all footnotes have 1 footnote reference marker

### Footnotes
- Make sure to check for errors when running script: `IndexError` and `MISSING`
- Make sure there is a number after each `c.`, indicating a chapter
- Remove all extra `*`'s
- Make sure all " e " have been translated to "and" where appropriate
- Keep an eye out for longer footnotes, these often are problematic
- All non italic text is in english
- Make sure greek text is retained
